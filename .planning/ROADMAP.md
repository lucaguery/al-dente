# Roadmap: Al Dente

## Completed Milestones

- **v0.1** ✅ (2026-05-05 → 2026-05-08) — Full PWA shipped: infra, onboarding, recipe library, LLM capture, daily shortlist, voting, cooking-log finalization, Web Push, realtime sync. 5 phases, 31 plans, 49 requirements. → [Archive](.planning/milestones/v0.1-ROADMAP.md)
- **v0.2** ✅ (2026-05-08) — Polish: Slow Food artisanal identity. Re-themed every surface (capture / decide / cook / onboarding) onto the Phase 5 design system (terracotta + warm-cream + Fraunces italic + paper-grain). Closed 5 W4 UI-REVIEW gaps inline (CAPTURE-11, DECIDE-05, COOK-07/08/11/12) plus the Phase 5 themeColor deferral. NEW PWA identity via Next.js 16 `app/icon.tsx`. UI audit average 22.4/24 across 5 phases (best 23/24). 5 phases, 26 plans, 31 requirements. → [Archive](.planning/milestones/v0.2-ROADMAP.md)
- **v0.2.1** ✅ (2026-05-08 → 2026-05-09) — E2E test infrastructure: one-command synthetic seed (`uv run seed` — 1 household + 2 members + 21 recipes + 3 cooking logs + 7 votes covering all 5 computed states, idempotent via uuid5+merge) + committed Playwright suite (14 specs across `seeded` and `fresh` projects, iPhone-shape Chromium viewport with `toBeInViewport()` on critical surfaces) + 4-command bootstrap runbook (`TESTING.md`). 1 phase, 7 plans, 4 requirements. → [Archive](.planning/milestones/v0.2.1-ROADMAP.md)
- **v0.3** ✅ (2026-05-09 → 2026-05-11) — Audit & Uniqueness Foundation. Audit-only milestone — zero new product features, zero product-code drift. 4 milestone-level artifacts in `.planning/v0.3/`: `RUNBOOK.md` (prod synthetic ops at `https://al-dente-pink.vercel.app`, code `DEMO01`), `WALKTHROUGH.md` (1,276 lines, ~64 severity-tagged findings across 14 surfaces, 8 GitHub issues filed #1-#8), `UI-AUDIT.md` (14 surface scores, mean 20.21/24, 5✅/9⚠/0❌), `ASSESSMENT.md` (510 lines, 27 ranked findings across 3 tiers ordered by impact on "feels Al Dente", anti-prescription gate enforced structurally via `check-assessment.sh`). 4 phases, 16 plans, 16 requirements. → [Archive](.planning/milestones/v0.3-ROADMAP.md)
- **v0.4** ✅ (2026-05-11) — Audit Remediation & Identity Polish. Closed both v0.3 Tier 1 invariant breaks (B-3 MEMBER_COUNT + B-4 cook_count idempotency), 4 Tier 2 correctness clusters (capture pipeline, history feature, identity management, validation surfaces), the C-1 token-completeness gap (15 new semantic CSS variables + emerald/member-color migration on 7 audit-cited surfaces), and the v0.2.2 backlog (TZ-01, SEED-01, POLISH-01/02). 6 surfaces flipped ⚠ Mixed → ✅ Feels Al Dente under the SAME 6-pillar rubric; cumulative mean 20.21/24 → 21.71/24 (+1.50). 7 phases, 27 plans, 24 requirements. → [Archive](.planning/milestones/v0.4-ROADMAP.md)

## Current Milestone

_None — awaiting next milestone via `/gsd-new-milestone`._

## Next Steps

- **Operator runtime pass** — 15 HUMAN-UAT items across phases 16/17/18/19/21 await physical-iPhone validation: Playwright suites against live dev stack, Web Push round-trip on both iPhones (`.planning/v0.4/PUSH-ROUNDTRIP.md`), Settings Notifications Card 4-state lifecycle, member-rename cross-phone realtime feel.
- **Behavioral validation gate** per `SPEC.md`: ≥ 2 weeks of daily use by both household members. Still the v0.1 definition of done; orthogonal to v0.4 phases.
- **Next milestone** — `/gsd-new-milestone` to start v0.5 (or v1.0 if dogfood gate passes).
